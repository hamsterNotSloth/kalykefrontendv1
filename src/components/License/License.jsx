                The designs available on Kalyke are subject to licenses and are not all free of copyrights. We describe on this page the terms and conditions of these licenses.

                Designers are the right holders of their files that you can download on Kalyke under the copyright laws. Applying a licence allows them to control how these files are shared, credited and used by the members. Each design has its own license.

                Members who download files on Kalyke agree to respect the licenses chosen by the designers. They must ensure that their use, attribution and sharing of the downloaded files will be compliant with the applied license.

                WORKING PRINCIPLE OF LICENSES
                Available licenses on Kalyke for designs fall into two categories: licenses for free digital files and licenses for paid digital files.

                Each license allows people who download digital files of a design from Kalyke to distribute them under some conditions within the boundaries of copyright law. They define the legal framework for the use, distribution, modification, copy and adaptation of the digital files of a design on Kalyke. They also ensure that the designers of these files, the right holders, get the credit for their work they deserve. They operate worldwide on a non-exclusive basis. Some licenses, including the Creatives Commons licenses, are irrevocable, for as long as applicable copyright lasts.

                Some licenses only allow non-commercial use. You can use designs under these licenses only if you apply and follow the attribution and sharing terms explicitly stated by the related license. You can use designs for marketing, monetization, sales, promotion and advertising with the intent of monetary return only on designs under commercial use licenses.

                QUESTIONS TO ASK YOURSELF
                For designers on Kalyke, you have to ask yourself:

                Do I want to allow commercial uses on my digital files?
                Do I want to allow modification on my digital files?
                Do I want to allow sharing of the adaptations of my design?
                Do I have the copyright on the design I want to share?
                For members who download digital files on Kalyke, you have to ask yourself:

                How will I use this digital file?
                How will I share this digital file?
                Kalyke require members who download digital files on the website to get permission from the designers, the right holders, to do any of the things that the license does not expressly allow.

                THE DEFAULT LICENSE ON CULTS
                By default, the Kalyke - Private Use license is applied to all designs on the site. As a designer, if you do not specify a license for your design, this license will be automatically applied.

                CULTS - PRIVATE USE
                You are authorized to:

                Print and use the 3D prints of the 3D model for private use, in unlimited quantity;
                Share the images of your 3D prints of the 3D model on communication media such as social networks or websites.
                What is not allowed:

                No commercial use or public sharing of the 3D model;
                No modification or adaptation of the 3D model for public sharing or sale;
                No distribution, sale, donation or exchange of the digital files of the 3D model.
