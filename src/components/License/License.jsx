                The designs available on Cults are subject to licenses and are not all free of copyrights. We describe on this page the terms and conditions of these licenses.
                Designers are the right holders of their files that you can download on Cults under the copyright laws. Applying a licence allows them to control how these files are shared, credited and used by the members. Each design has its own license.
                Members who download files on Cults agree to respect the licenses chosen by the designers. They must ensure that their use, attribution and sharing of the downloaded files will be compliant with the applied license.

                <p className='mt-3'>
                    Available licenses on Cults for designs fall into two categories: licenses for free digital files and licenses for paid digital files.
                </p>
                <p className='mt-3'>
                    Each license allows people who download digital files of a design from Cults to distribute them under some conditions within the boundaries of copyright law. They define the legal framework for the use, distribution, modification, copy and adaptation of the digital files of a design on Cults. They also ensure that the designers of these files, the right holders, get the credit for their work they deserve. They operate worldwide on a non-exclusive basis. Some licenses, including the Creatives Commons licenses, are irrevocable, for as long as applicable copyright lasts.
                </p>
                <p className='mt-3'>
                    Some licenses only allow non-commercial use. You can use designs under these licenses only if you apply and follow <b>the attribution and sharing terms</b> explicitly stated by the related license. You can use designs <b>for marketing, monetization</b>, sales, promotion and advertising with the intent of monetary return only on designs under commercial use licenses.
